C++ Project in Google Colab

This repository contains a C++ project implemented and executed within a **Google Colab** notebook. It demonstrates how to write, compile, and run C++ code directly in a Colab environment using simple shell commands.

 Project Overview

This project is an example of how C++ can be used inside Google Colab notebooks for learning, demonstrations, or small-scale development.

Features:
- Write C++ code using `%%writefile`
- Compile with `!g++`
- Execute compiled binaries in Colab
- Combine C++ logic with markdown and output visualization

File Included

- `C++_Project.ipynb`: The main notebook file with code, explanations, and outputs.

 How It Works

In Colab:
1. C++ code is saved to a file using:
   ```cpp
   %%writefile filename.cpp
